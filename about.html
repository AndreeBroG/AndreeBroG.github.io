                   <p> I'm a boy who loves to play video games and have fun. I also like to eat food like: burgers, pizza, and spaghetti. I watch cartoons from time to time.
                   </p>
                   <p> I really care for my family and make sure I am always with them when they need me. I also like partys as they're really fun to be at and to pass time. Finally I also like to program and work on computers.
